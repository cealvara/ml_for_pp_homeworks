    "\n",
    "We know the **Total calls about Graffitis are 116,981**. Moreover, we also know that calls from NORTH LAWNDALE and SOUTH LAWNDALE about Graffiti Removal are (486 + 5301) = 5,787. Finally, we know that calls about Graffitis from UPTOWN are 1778.\n",

    "Given the information in the HW, we know that **Total calls about Graffitis are 260.**\n",

    "P(Uptown | Graffiti Removal) = 160 / 260 = 61.5%\n",
